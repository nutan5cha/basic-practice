        <p>enum:Enums allow a developer to define a set of named constants. Using enums can make it easier to document intent, or create a set of distinct cases. TypeScript provides both numeric and string-based enums.
            Numeric enums
            Well first start off with numeric enums, which are probably more familiar if you are coming from other languages. An enum can be defined using the enum keyword.
            
            enum Direction {
              Up = 1,
              Down,
              Left,
              Right,
            }</p>
